Creating APIs using Express
In Client Server architecture, each component is isolated from each other.

Memory heap is responsible for creating memory for the objects we create in our code

Call stack is responsible for exection of each and every line that is present in our code

Express library is used to build REST APIs and perform testing

^version-number means any version above version number

package-lock.json is generated by node to contain all information about the dependencies.

node_modules contains all the packages that we install as dependencies
It will contains folder for all the packages you install
Generally we run application on port 8080

By default CURL request is GET request
If its a GET request, we can hit it from our browser also

For making post request using CURL;
curl -X POST <endpoint>
Eg: curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/

Conventions to follow while creating APIs
- We create services; then we fetch data from data from those services 
- APIs must have proper routing so that we can hit proper endpoint and there is clear communication of data between files

npm body-parser will allow you to pass data to POST request. Body parser extracts the data object we have passed and makes it available to request body. We will use this as a middleware (between API request and Server response). body-parser exposes the data we pass into request body object.

To make a POST request and pass data in request body (also use body-parser): curl -X POST -d '{"name": "Harry"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:5000/api/v1/user
-d parameter is used to specify the data; -H is for header 

Standards to follow while creating APIs:
- Create separate folder for separate API endpoints
- Keep business logic of API in services folder or a helper folder; to fetch data use APIs; to change API logic, see service folder
- We can create multiple requests for a single endpoint
